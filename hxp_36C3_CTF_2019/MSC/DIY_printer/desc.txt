Description:
I found some source code for a do-it-yourself flag printer but it looks like it only builds using this weird cmake source. I tried everything I could think of, i.e.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
but it didn’t work :( I never understood that build system stuff so can you please help me out?

(You should be able to safely ignore the *.h and *.c files — they are just to print the flag when you succeed.)
