Description:
We made a tetris game but we’re not sure whether it’s actually winnable. Can you please check?

If you execute on hardware that sucks (i.e. not GT740M, GTX970, GTX1080, RTX2060, UHD 620, UHD 630, or any AMD) or software that sucks (i.e. not OpenGL version 4.6) the program might complain that some GL function was not loaded. This is not necessarily a hard error. It’s a hard error if it crashes. :)

But even hard errors are, unfortunately, totally your problem.

Good luck.
