Note that the setup of this task is perhaps a bit shaky: If you don’t get a shell prompt within a few seconds after solving the proof of work, something is wrong. Each connection has a time limit of 5 minutes and 30 seconds of CPU time, whichever happens first; you may contact us in case this causes problems for you.
